# Binary Classification with Quantum Variational Circuit

The focus of this work is the construction of a quantum variational circuit capable of classifying classical data. That said, our system will consist of both a quantum and a classical component.  

- **Quantum Component (Quantum Circuit):** A block responsible for encoding/embedding, a block responsible for the variational algorithm, and measurement blocks.  

- **Classical Component:** Post-processing (associating measurements with labels), loss function computation, and optimization of variational parameters (Î¸) (see Fig. 1). In some cases, special classical preprocessing may also be necessary, such as dimensionality reduction of the dataset using PCA techniques [1].

These first two components (quantum circuit and post-processing) are connected in a loop, creating a hybrid system between quantum and classical computing.
